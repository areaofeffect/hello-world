# Hello World: The Logic of Interaction

##### FALL 2024

##### INSTRUCTORS: Carrie Kengle, Bruno Kruse

##### DURATION: 15 weeks

##### TIME: Monday 5:00pm - 7:50pm

<br/>

#### TLDR;

Hello World - The Logic of Interaction, is a class about learning to code and communicating with machines. By the end of this class you should have the skills to speak the language of (almost) any machine using fundamentals from Python, JavaScript and C.

We’ll dive into:

- Building a foundation and understanding of basic software principles.

- Using code as a tool for art or design

- We'll code 'til it works' as self-taught scrappy programmers.

- Analyze a variety of programming languages and systems; understanding how they work and applications of each.

- Learning about best practices and collaboration.

#### COURSE DESCRIPTION

Hello World is traditionally the very first program people write when they are new to a programming language. It’s used to test programming syntax, implementation and sanity. Did it work?

The goal of this class is to provide you with a primer into understanding the world of computer hardware, software and designing with code. We'll start with a foundation in programming and build programs of increasing complexity as the course progresses.

This class will provide you with the tools you need to read and understand source code, critically think about software applications and write your very own programs.

How does a processor work and what is a for loop? How do we use code as a tool to solve day-to-day problems? How is software created and distributed?
