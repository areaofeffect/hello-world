# MQTT

Let's install MQTT using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) Run each of the following commands in Terminal

#### 1

    /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/main/install)"

#### 2

    brew install mosquitto

#### 3

    ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/mosquitto/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents

#### 4

    launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mosquitto.plist

## Testing MQTT

Now that you have the Mosquitto broker and clients install on your computer, you can begin publishing and subscribing to messages. Open two separate windows in Terminal and run the following commands in each to test.

#### Terminal Window 1

    mosquitto_sub -h 127.0.0.1 -t hello

#### Terminal Window 2

    mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -t hello -m world

## Combining MQTT with Node

We will add MQTT to [one of our apps from last class](https://github.com/areaofeffect/hello-world/tree/main/week8#building-some-isomorphic-javascript-apps).

### Node + Serial + MQTT

    meteor create serial-mqtt-app
    cd serial-mqtt-app
    meteor npm install serialport --save
    meteor npm install mqtt --save
    meteor npm install react-p5-wrapper --save
    meteor npm install --save react react-dom
    meteor add react-meteor-data
    meteor

How to find the path to your serial port

    ls -al /dev/cu*
