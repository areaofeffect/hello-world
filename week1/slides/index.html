# Resources and Office Hours

- Office Hours
  - Quick questions, project help, code review
  - In person: Tuesdays 6-7:30 (after class)
  - Web / Skype / Hangout: Schedule with us in advance
- Slack
- Posting Assignments
  - Due 12:00pm before class

# Class Methods
- The idea of the class is to immerse you in programming and learn a new language or method by the time we are done.

# Code as a tool

- We'll and code as as an additional tool to our design process, solving complex and specific problems in our projects.
- We'll show you what tools and systems are available. It's up to you to
choose what you need. We'll help you a long the way.


---
class: inverse, left, middle, large

# Code + Design

- If you already know programming, thats great! We'll continue to reinforce
these skills and learn new ones even faster. Try Swift!
- Design wise, we'll measure our successes by not only the code we write, but
the problems code enables us to solve.
- We'll learn how to evaluate what's good Copy Pasta v.s bad Copy Pasta. We want you to own your successes and failures.
