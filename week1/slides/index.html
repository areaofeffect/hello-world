# Resources and Office Hours

- Office Hours
  - Quick questions, project help, code review
  - In person: Wednesdays 5-6:30 (after class)
  - Video calls: Schedule with us in advance
- Slack
- Posting Assignments
  - You will be presenting your assignments in class
  - Aim to be complete by 12:00pm on Wednesdays

---
class: inverse, left, middle, large

# Class Methods
- The idea of the class is to immerse you in programming concepts. You will learn a new language (or two!) by the time we are done.

# Code as a tool

- We'll add code as an additional tool to our design process. Learning how to solve complex and specific problems in our projects.
- We'll show you what tools and systems are available. It's up to you to
choose what you need. We'll help you a long the way.


---
class: inverse, left, middle, large

# Code + Design

- If you already know programming, thats great! We'll continue to reinforce
these skills and learn new ones even faster.  
- Design wise, we'll measure our successes by not only the code we write, but
the problems code enables us to solve.
- We'll learn how to evaluate what's good Copy Pasta vs bad Copy Pasta. We want you to own your successes and failures.

# Learning in Real-time
- Lot's of feedback and communication.
- Coding is massive; we want to know what's confusing and what's not.
- Join our #slack channel.
