### Variables

> a variable is a storage location paired with an associated symbolic name (an identifier), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value.

# Data Types

> a data type or simply type is a classification of data which tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data.

### Every variable you create will be of a certain data type.

#### Let's explore some [primitive data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures#Data_types)

_types that are built in to the programming language_

- Boolean
- String
- Number

#### And some [composite types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_data_type)

- Arrays
- Objects

## Booleans

A var of this type can only have 1 of 2 possible values. True or False, yes or no, on or off.
JavaScript example

    var myBool = true

Python example

    myBool = True

C example

    boolean myBool = true

## Characters and Strings

[BK: image of character, image of string]

A character is a single character, and string is a sequence of characters.

JavaScript example

    var myString = "Hello World"

Python example

    myString = "Hello World"

C example

```
	char myCharacter = 'A'; // this is just a single character
	char *myString = "Hello world"; //string literal, cannot be changed
	char myString[] = "Hello world"; //newly allocated memory
```

Last week's questions about single quote vs double quotes applies here to the C example, but the Python and JavaScript examples are interchangeable so long as they match.

### Delimiters

A common delimiter is a comma (,) or pipe (|).

> A delimiter is a sequence of one or more characters used to specify the boundary between separate, independent regions in plain text or other data streams.[1] An example of a delimiter is the comma character, which acts as a field delimiter in a sequence of comma-separated values. Another example of a delimiter is the time gap used to separate letters and words in the transmission of Morse code.

[Wikipedia Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter)

Understanding and using delimiters in strings will be important once we get to conversion a little later in class.

### String Concatenation

Joining character strings end to end.

JavaScript example

    var myString = "Hello" + " World"

Python example

    myString = "".join(["Hello ", "World"])

C example. There is no string concatentation operator in C. Luckily, Arduino provides a nice [String](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/StringObject) class with a concat method for you.

[CTD::: we'll talk about arduino and strings later :)]

## Numbers

The two main types of numbers you'll decide between in most cases are _integers_ or _floating point decimals_. Floats are used when more preceision is required.

Some things, like pi, cannot be expressed as an integer.

In Javascript, though things are rapidly changing, there is one type of [number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-1985#Double-precision_64_bit). Later in class during we will discuss builtin function `parseInt` and `parseFloat`.

### Integers

    -1, 0, 1, 2

JavaScript example

    var myInt = 1

Python example

    myInt = 1

C example

    int myInt = 1

### Floats

    -0.1, 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 3.14

JavaScript example

    var myFloat = 3.14

Python example

    myFloat = 3.14

C example

    float myFloat = 3.14

### Further Number Types

#### NaN

Not a Number, If, for example, you attempt to divide by zero.

- [bk: willy nillying]

#### Binary and Hexadecimal

Binary representations of number use only ones and zeros. Hexadecimal can represent 8 binary characters with 2 consecutive hexadecimal digits and therefore save space.

- [The Martian hexidecimal reference getting nerdy](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/107675/why-does-mark-use-hexadecimal-to-communicate)

[bk: get the martian movie to show the scene]

#### A side note about Bases

> In mathematical numeral systems, the radix or base is the number of unique digits, including zero, used to represent numbers in a positional numeral system. For example, for the decimal system (the most common system in use today) the radix is ten, because it uses the ten digits from 0 through 9.

Wikipedia definition of [Radix or base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix)

[Number bases introduction](http://www.purplemath.com/modules/numbbase.htm)

Binary = base 2

Decimal = base 10

Hexadecimal = base 16

## Arrays

[bk: why can't I hold all these vars]
[bk: zero index]
[bk: refridgerator example]

List of items, all of the same data type.

JavaScript example

    var myArray = ["Water", "Apple", "Banana"];

Python example, (there is an array module in python, but we will use list)

    myList = ["Water", "Apple", "Banana"]

C example

    char myArray [ 3 ] = {"Water", "Apple", "Banana"}

[Code Academy's excellent explanation](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/web-beginner-en-8a35h/0/1)

## Objects

Objects are collections of properties

JavaScript example

    var myObj = {fuel_type: "electric", model: "S", color: "red"};

Python example, (dictionary)

    myDict = {fuel_type: "electric", model: "S", color: "red"}

C example

    typedef struct {
      char *fuel_type;
      char *model;
      char *color;
    } tesla;

    struct tesla s;

# Conversion from one Data Type to Another

Converting one data type to another. Why would you need this?

Conversion from one Data Type to Another

### String -> Number

Python example

```
myString = "1";
myNum = int(myString)
```

JavaScript example

```
var myString = "1";
var myNum = parseInt(myString)
```

C example

There is no built in method in C for this conversion. Arduino's [String](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/StringObject) class has a toInt() function.

### Number -> String

Python example

```
myNum = 1;
myString = str(myNum)
```

JavaScript example

```
var myNum = 1;
var myString = myNum.toString();
```

### Number -> String

C example

There is no built in method in C for this conversion. Arduino can use `itoa()` from the stdlib C library.

```
int myNum = 1;
char buffer[10];
itoa(myNum,buffer,10); // base 10
```

### String -> Bool

Python example

```
myString = "True";
myBool = (myString == "True")
```

JavaScript example

```
var myString = "true";
var myBool = (myString == "true")
```

C example

We would recommend not using the strings "True" or "true", but perhaps use 0 and 1 and use other conversions.

### String -> Array

<!-- [ example or string that's delimited ]
[bk: example -->

Python example

```
myString = "January 5th, 1978"
myArray = myString.split(",")
```

Javascript example

```
var myString = "January 5th, 1978";
var myArray = myString.split(",");
```

### Array -> String

Python example

```
myList = ["1", "2", "3"]
myString = "".join(myList)
```

JavaScript example

```javascript
var myArray = ["January 5th", "1978"];
var myString = myArray.join(",");
```

## Strict Typing, Strong or Weak, Static or Dynamic

Which language out of our three do you think is strictly typed?

If you guessed C, you are correct! Each time we delcared a variable we had to preceed it with it's type. This tells the compiler that you cannot interact with this variable outside of it's type.

Strong and weak typing are phrases that loosely correlate to Static and Dynamic. Static means the typing happens at the compile phase, and dynamic means it happens at runtime.

## Readability

### Naming conventions

Increasing the readability of your code will make working with others easier.

Decide on using camelCase or snake-case

- var myName = "firstname lastname"

Remeber that variables can't start with a number.

### Comments

Comment to help others understand what your code does.
Python example

```
# comment here
```

JavaScript example

```
// comment here
```

# Madlib code example

Fun times! we will use all our new knowledge to build a mad lib

steps to initializing a variable

1. datatype (var, int, etc... )(some languages like python you don't have to do this)
2. variable name
3. assignment operator (=, and a note on ==)
4. the value

## Assignments

### Assignment 1

Pick four objects in everyday life and represent them as a data type.

### Assignment 2

Create an object and verify it using https://jsonlint.com/

Example:

```
{
  "name": "Tony",
  "location": "zoo",
  "genus": "Tiger",
  "species": "Cat",
  "count": 3,
  "furry": false
}
```

### Assignment 3

Create your own story algorithm. You can modify an example from class (story maker) or create your own. Remember to comment your code and use examples of: - user inputs - variables (int or float, string, boolean) - concatenation

## Thought Experiment

This should be a fun 20 to 30 minute idea session. This can be free form, and you do not need to build a working version of your idea.

Think of a way to represent a number, string, array optgroup object in a dynamic medium. Bring in your example for next class.
