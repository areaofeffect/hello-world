### Every variable you create will be of a certain data type.

#### Let's explore some [primitive data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures#Data_types)
*types that are built in to the programming language*

- Boolean
- Number
- String

#### And some [composite types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_data_type)

- Arrays
- Objects

# Numbers
The two main types of numbers you'll decide between in most cases are *integers* or *floating point decimals*. Floats are used when more precision is required.

Some things, like pi, cannot be expressed as an integer.
.center[![Center-aligned image](./images/pi.png)]

In Javascript, though things are rapidly changing, there is one type of [number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754-1985#Double-precision_64_bit). Later in class during we will discuss built-in functions `parseInt` and `parseFloat`.

Numbers
# NaN
Not a Number

If, for example, you attempt to obtain an integer from dividing 2 numbers and you accidentally divide by zero, you may receive this result because any number divided by zero is inifinity.

Trying to perform mathematic operations on a string data type, will also result in this warning.

---

class: inverse
Numbers
# Bases
> In mathematical numeral systems, the radix or base is the number of unique digits, including zero, used to represent numbers in a positional numeral system. For example, for the decimal system (the most common system in use today) the radix is ten, because it uses the ten digits from 0 through 9.

Wikipedia definition of [Radix or base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix)

[Number bases introduction](http://www.purplemath.com/modules/numbbase.htm)

Binary = base 2

Decimal = base 10

Hexadecimal = base 16

---
class: inverse
Numbers
# Binary and Hexadecimal
Binary representations of number use only ones and zeros. Hexadecimal can represent 8 binary characters with 2 consecutive hexadecimal digits and therefore save space.

Characters and Strings
# Examples
Python example
```
myString = "Hello World"
print(myString)
```

JavaScript example
```
let myString = "Hello World";
console.log(myString);

Characters and Strings
# Concatentation

Joining character strings end to end.

Python example
```python
myString = "Hello, my name is "
myName = "Carrie"
print(myString + myName)

```
<!-- myString = "".join(["Hello ", "World"]) -->

JavaScript example
```
let myString = "Hello, my name is "
let myName = "Bruno"
console.log(myString + myName);
```

# Concatentation

There is no string concatentation operator in C. Luckily, Arduino provides a nice [String](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/StringObject) class with a concat method for you.

How can we separate strings into smaller strings?

# Delimiters

> A [delimiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter) is a sequence of one or more characters used to specify the boundary between separate, independent regions in plain text or other data streams. An example of a delimiter is the comma character, which acts as a field delimiter in a sequence of comma-separated values. Another example of a delimiter is the time gap used to separate letters and words in the transmission of Morse code.

Stated more plainly, a delimiter is a character that marks the beginning or end of a unit of data.   
Common delimiters are commas (,) or pipes (|).

# Delimiter examples

### What if we want to pass the RGB value for an something that we want to turn red? Maybe a game element, an LED, or even a lightbulb?

We know that the following is a valid set of numbers for an RGB value of red:  
Red: 255  
Green: 0  
Blue: 0    


We could represent this as a comma delimited string like this. This format would be much easier to pass over serial as an example.  
`255,0,0`

Let's see some code examples on how we could retrieve individual red, green and blue values on the next slide.
---
class: inverse, medium
Characters and Strings
# Substring Examples
Python 
```
myColorString = "255,0,0"
(r,g,b) = myColorString.split(",") # destructuring assignment
print(r)
```

JavaScript 
```
let myColorString = "255,0,0";
let [r,g,b] = myColorString.split(",") // destructuring assignment
console.log(r);
```

C   
Splitting strings in C requires the use of a loop AND a delimiter. We can explore this when we learn loops.

# Arrays

Python example, ([there is an array module in python, but we will use list](https://learnpython.com/blog/python-array-vs-list/))
````
myList = ["Water", "Apple", "Banana"]
print(myList)
print(myList[0]) #this will print Water
```
JavaScript example
```javascript
let myArray = ["Water", "Apple", "Banana"];
console.log(myArray);
console.log(myArray[0]); //this will log Water
```

C example
```
char myArray[3] = {"Water", "Apple", "Banana"};

# Objects

Objects are collections of properties



Python example, (objects are called dictionaries in python)
```
myObj = {"top": 0, "left": 0, "width": 100, "height": 100, "color": "red"}
print(myObj)
print(myObj["color"])
```
JavaScript example
```javascript
let myObj = {"top": 0, "left": 0, "width": 100, "height": 100, "color": "red"};
console.log(myObj);
console.log(myObj.color);
```

Conversion from one Data Type to Another
# String -> Bool

#### We will cover this in more detail next week when we learn conditionals.

Python example
```
myString = "True"
myBool = (myString == "True")
```

JavaScript example
```javascript
let myString = "true";
let myBool = (myString == "true")
```

C example

We would recommend not using the strings "True" or "true", but perhaps use 0 and 1 and use other conversions.

More on Data Types
# Strict Typing, Strong or Weak, Static or Dynamic

Which language out of our three do you think is strictly typed?

---

class: inverse
More on Data Types
# Strict Typing, Strong or Weak, Static or Dynamic

If you guessed C, you are correct!

Each time we delcared a variable we had to preceed it with it's type. This tells the compiler that you cannot interact with this variable outside of it's type.

Strong and weak typing are phrases that loosely correlate to Static and Dynamic. Static means the typing happens at the compile phase, while Dynamic means it happens at runtime.

# Naming conventions
Increasing the readability of your code will make working with others easier. Remember not to use any [reserved words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserved_word) for your language as the variable name. A common style is camelCase
- let myName = "firstname lastname"

Python rules
- Remember that variables can't start with a number
- Start with an underscore ( _ ) or letter
- Use only letters, numbers or underscores for the rest of the variable name
- Remember python is case-sensitive

JavaScript rules
- Same as Python
- Variable names may also contain dollar signs ( $ )

C rules
- Same as python

 # Thought Experiment

 This should be a fun 20 to 30 minute idea session. This can be free form, and you do not need to build a working version of your idea.

 Think of a way to represent a number, string, array or an object in a dynamic medium.  Bring in or share your example in the next class.
