# Review of Objects

_Time Series Data_

Useful for data analysis like visualizations, pattern recognition, signal processing, and even things like machine learning.

Let's take for example analyzing the temperature of this room over time and then visualizing that data. Each discrete timestamp could be represented by an object.

```
{
  "timestamp": "2017-09-17T12:00:00.000Z",
  "temp": 71
}
```

Saving one object per minute would give you 60 temperatures to plot overtime to analyze the temp changes. Some companies are using data like this to make heating buildings more efficient.

# Operators

_an operator is a character that represents an action_

Like data types, there are many different types of operators. We've already used the assignment operator, let's explore a few more.

.center.center-50[![Center-aligned image](./images/operator.jpg)]

---
class: inverse, left
# Assignment operators
_Let's think of the light in a room. What is it's current state? What happens to the assignment when that state changes?_

Python example
```python
isOn = True
isoOn = False
```
    
JavaScript example
```javascript
var isOn = true
isOn = false
```

C example
```c
boolean isOn = true
isOn = false
```

# Arithmetic operators

### addition ( + )

### substraction ( - ) 

### multiplication ( \* )

### division ( / )

### modulo ( % )

---
class: inverse, left
# Order of operations
Some operators are given a higher precedence.

PEMDAS
 _Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally_

Parentheses

Exponents

Multiplication

Division

Addition

Subtraction

```
6 * (5 + 3) = 48
6 * 5 + 3 = 33

```

---
class: inverse, left
Arithmetic operators
# increment ( ++ )

Python example
```python 
studentsInClass = 0
studentsInClass += 1 # studentsInClass will be 1
 ```

JavaScript example
```javascript
var studentsInClass = 1;
studentsInClass++; // studentsInClass will be 2
```

C example
```
int studentsInClass = 2;
studentsInClass++; // studentsInClass will be 2
```

---
class: inverse, left
Arithmetic operators
# decrement ( -- )

Python example
```python 
studentsInClass = 1
studentsInClass -= 1
 ```

JavaScript example
```javascript
var studentsInClass = 1;
studentsInClass--;
```

C example
```c
int studentsInClass = 1;
studentsInClass--;
```

---
class: inverse, left
Arithmetic operators
# increment, decrement and placement
_a note about placement_

For JavaScript and C, you can place this operator before your variable like this, `++count`. Depending on how you use your variable you may get different results.

```javascript
var count = 3;
x = 0;
x = ++count; // x==4, count==4
x = count++; // x==3, count==4
```

---
class: inverse, left
# Comparison operators

_Comparison operators yield Boolean values_

### **==**  ...    equal to

### **!=**  ...    not equal to

### **\>**  ...   greater than

### **<**   ...    less than

### **\>=** ...   great than or equal to

### **<=**  ...   less than or equal to

---
class: inverse, left
Comparison Operations on data types
# Strings
Python example
```python 
teachers = ["bruno", "carrie"]
haveSameName = (teachers[0] is teachers[1]) # False
```

JavaScript example
```javascript
var teachers = ["bruno", "carrie"]
var slackHandle = ["brun.no", "carrie"]
var nameMatchesSlackHandle = (teachers[0] == slackHandle[0]) // false
```
C example

The operators `!=` and `==` only compare the memory addresses and not the actual String contents so you have to `strcmp`


---
class: inverse, left
Comparison Operations on data types

# Numbers

Python example
```python  
x = 1
y = 2
print (x < y) # False
```    

JavaScript example
```javascript
var isGreater = (x > y); // false
```

C example

```c
boolean isGreater = (x > y); // true
```

---
class: inverse, left
# Logical operators

With logical operators you can combine one or more comparisons to make more complex decisions.

We know that Booleans were one of our primitive data types in computer science. Now we are going to learn about Boolean logic. We will use it in our programs, but it is interesting to note that the this same logic is a core component of a computer's CPU.

Logic circuits include such devices as multiplexers, registers, arithmetic logic units (ALUs), and computer memory, all the way up through complete microprocessors, which may contain more than 100 million gates.

# Logical operators

Let's set up some parameters to work with while we review how to use this operators to make more complex decisions.

We're building a game. We have to guide the character through based on their current level and the decisions they make.

---
class: inverse, left
# Logical AND ( && )

Python example
```python
(x < y and myString is "hello") # True
```

JavaScript example
```javascript
var isGreater = (x > y && myString == "world") // false
```

C example
```c
int x = 0;
int y = 10;
boolean bothAreNonZero = (a && b); // false
```


---
class: inverse, left
# Logical NOT ( ! )

Python example
```python  
x = 1
y = 2
!(x > y) # False
```

JavaScript example
```javascript
var isGreater = !(x > y) // true
```

C example
```c
int x = 0;
int y = 10;
boolean bothAreNonZero = !(a && b); // true
```

---
class: inverse, left
# Logical OR ( || )

Python example
```python  
x = 1
y = 2
(x > y || x > 0) # True
```

JavaScript example
```javascript
var isGreater = (x > y || y > 2) // false
```

C example
```c
boolean oneIsNonZero = (x || y) // true
```

class: inverse, left
# Additional Operators
Just like there were more data types than we covered in class last week, there are also more operators. Here are a few types to explore on your own.

Bitwise Operators

[Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators) | [JavaScript](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/operators/bitwise-operator.php) | [C](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_bitwise_operators.htm)

[Compound Assignment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/scripting/javascript/reference/compound-assignment-operators-javascript)

[Ternary conditional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F:)

# Conditional Statements

Now that we've reviewed the operators that evaluate our variables into meaningful logic, we are ready to make deicisions. Enter the mighty if statement!

---
class: inverse, left
Conditional Statements
## If


Python example
```python 
if (x < y):
  print "x is less than y"
```

JavaScript example
```javascript
var isGreater = (x > y) // false
if (isGreater) {
  console.log( "x is greater than y")
}
```

C example
```
boolean isGreater = (x > y) // true
if (isGreater) {
printf("isGreater is true");
```

---
class: inverse, left
Conditional Statements
## Else
In the case that the conditional expression in your if statement is not true, you may want to do something else.

Python example
```python  
if (x < y):
  print "x is less than y"
else:
  print "y is less than x"
```

JavaScript example
```javascript
if (x > y) {
  console.log( "x is greater than y")
} else {
  console.log( "y is greater than x")
}
```
---
class: inverse, left
Conditional Statements
## Else

C example
```
if (x > y) {
  printf( "x is greater than y")
} else {
  printf( "y is greater than x")
}
```
---
class: inverse, left
## Elif
Python can only have one else. But it can have many `elif`

Python example
```python
import math
x = 'nan'
y = 1
if (x < y):
  print "x is less than y"
elif math.isnan(float(x)):
  print "x is NaN"
else:
  print "y is less than x"
```

# Functions

> In programming, a named section of a program that performs a specific task. In this sense, a function is a type of procedure or routine. Some programming languages make a distinction between a function, which returns a value, and a procedure, which performs some operation but does not return a value.
Most programming languages come with a prewritten set of functions that are kept in a library. You can also write your own functions to perform specialized tasks.

http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/F/function.html

---
class: inverse, left
Functions
## Declaration

Python example
```python  

def myFunction():
  # statements here

```

JavaScript example
```javascript
function myFunction() {
  // statements here
}
```

C example
```
boolean myFunction () {
  // statements here
}
```

---
class: inverse, left
Functions
## Definition

Python example
```python  
def isGreater(x, y):
  return (x > y)

```

JavaScript example
```javascript
function isGreater(x, y) {
  return (x > y);
}
```

C example
```
boolean isGreater (int x, int y) {
  boolean returnVal = (x > y); // true
  return returnVal;
}
```

---
class: inverse, left
Functions
## Parameters and Arguments

In the last slide `x` and `y` are parameters of the function. 

The values you pass in for `x` and `y` are known as arguments.

Python example
```python  
def isGreater(x, y):
  return (x > y)

isGreater(0,1) #False
isGreater(1,0) #True

```
