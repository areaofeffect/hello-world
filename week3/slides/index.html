# Review of Objects

_Time Series Data_

Useful for data analysis like visualizations, pattern recognition, signal processing, and even things like machine learning.

Let's take for example analyzing the temperature of this room over time and then visualizing that data. Each discrete timestamp could be represented by an object.

```
{
  "timestamp": "2017-09-17T12:00:00.000Z",
  "temp": 71
}
```

Saving one object per minute would give you 60 temperatures to plot overtime to analyze the temp changes. Some companies are using data like this to make heating buildings more efficient.

# Operators

_an operator is a character that represents an action_

Like data types, there are many different types of operators. We've already used the assignment operator, let's explore a few more.

.center.center-50[![Center-aligned image](./images/operator.jpg)]

---
class: inverse, left
# Assignment operators
_Let's think of the light in a room. What is it's current state? What happens to the assignment when that state changes?_

Python example
```python
isOn = True
isOn = False
```
    
JavaScript example
```javascript
let isOn = true
isOn = false
```

C example
```c
boolean isOn = true;
isOn = false;
```

class: inverse, left
# Arithmetic operators

### addition ( <span style="color:white">+</span> )

### substraction ( <span style="color:white">-</span> ) 

### multiplication ( <span style="color:white">\*</span> )

### division ( <span style="color:white">/</span> )

### modulo ( <span style="color:white">%</span> )

### exponent ( <span style="color:white">\**</span> )

---
class: inverse, left
# Order of operations
What happens first? Some operators are given a higher precedence. Here is a way to remember it.

**PEMDAS** _Please Excuse My Dear Aunt Sally_

1 <span style="color:white">P </span>Parentheses - <span style="color:white">(</span> anything here happens first <span style="color:white">)</span>

2 <span style="color:white">E </span> Exponents - <span style="color:white">\**</span> (powers, square roots)

3 <span style="color:white">MD </span> Multiplication - <span style="color:white">\* </span> Division - <span style="color:white">/</span> (left to right)

4 <span style="color:white">AS</span> Addition - <span style="color:white">+ </span>Subtraction - <span style="color:white">=</span> (left to right)

```
6 * (5 + 3) = 48
6 * 5 + 3 = 33

```

---
class: inverse, left
Arithmetic operators
# increment ( ++ )

Python example
```python 
studentsInClass = 0
studentsInClass += 1 # studentsInClass will be 1
 ```

JavaScript example
```javascript
let studentsInClass = 1;
studentsInClass++; // studentsInClass will be 2
```

C example
```
int studentsInClass = 2;
studentsInClass++; // studentsInClass will be 2
```

---
class: inverse, left
Arithmetic operators
# decrement ( -- )

Python example
```python 
studentsInClass = 1
studentsInClass -= 1
 ```

JavaScript example
```javascript
let studentsInClass = 1;
studentsInClass--;
```

C example
```c
int studentsInClass = 1;
studentsInClass--;
```

---
class: inverse, left
Arithmetic operators
# increment, decrement and placement
_a note about placement_

For JavaScript and C, you can place this operator before your variable like this, `++count`. This will increment the variable before the expression is evaluated. This is called a prefix operator.

```javascript
let count = 3;
let x = 0;
x = ++count;
console.log(x); // 4  (pre-increment)
console.log(count); // 4

let count = 3;
let x = 0;
x = count++;
console.log(x); // 3 (post-increment)
console.log(count); // 4
```


---
class: inverse, left
# Comparison operators

_Comparison operators yield Boolean values_

### <span style="color:white">**==**</span>    equal to

### <span style="color:white">**!=**</span>    not equal to

### <span style="color:white">**\>**</span>     greater than

### <span style="color:white">**<**</span>       less than

### <span style="color:white">**\>=**</span>    great than or equal to

### <span style="color:white">**<=**</span>     less than or equal to

---
class: inverse, left
Comparison Operations on data types
# Strings
Python example
```python 
teachers = ["bruno", "carrie"]
haveSameName = (teachers[0] == teachers[1]) # False
doNotHaveSameName = (teachers[0] != teachers[1]) # True
```

JavaScript example
```javascript
let teachers = ["bruno", "carrie"]
let slackHandle = ["brun.no", "carrie"]
let nameMatchesSlackHandle = (teachers[0] == slackHandle[0]) // false
```
C example

The operators `!=` and `==` only compare the memory addresses and not the actual String contents so you have to `strcmp`


---
class: inverse, left
Comparison Operations on data types

# Numbers

Python example
```python  
x = 1
y = 2
print(x < y) # False
```    

JavaScript example
```javascript
let isGreater = (x > y); // false
```

C example

```c
boolean isGreater = (x > y); // true
```

---
class: inverse, left
# Logical operators

With logical operators you can combine one or more comparisons to make more complex decisions.

We know that Booleans are primitive data types from last week's class. Now we are going to learn about Boolean logic. We will use it in our programs, but it is interesting to note that the this same logic is a core component of a computer's CPU.

Logic circuits include such devices as multiplexers, registers, arithmetic logic units (ALUs), and computer memory, all the way up through complete microprocessors, which may contain more than 100 million gates.

class: inverse, left
# Logical operators

Let's set up some parameters to work with while we review how to use these operators to make more complex decisions.

Later in class we will journey into the deep deep forest, our path will follow the decisions we make. Our options are based on the places we've been. We'll need the machine to make logical decisions to help us on our way.

We will perform some logical operations to learn about the state of these variables:  
<span style="color:white">yourLocation</span>, <span style="color:white">yourItem</span> and <span style="color:white">yourFriends</span>. 

### Let's look at some pseudo code.

---
class: inverse, left
# Logical AND ( && )

pseudocode: If the player's location is the correct location (theLocation) AND the player has the required item (requiredItem), then the player can levelup

Python example

```python
levelUp = (yourLocation == theLocation and yourItem == requiredItem)
if (levelUp) {
    // do something
}
```

JavaScript example
```javascript
let levelUp = (yourLocation == theLocation && yourItem == requiredItem);
```

C example
```c
int correctLocation = (yourLocation == theLocation); // compare 2 strings
int correctItem = (yourItem == requiredItem); // compare 2 strings
boolean levelUp = (correctLocation && correctItem);
```

---
class: inverse, left
# Logical NOT ( ! )

If your player has not befriended the correct person, then you must go back and befriend them before leveling up.

Python example
```python  
hasFriend = not(neededFriend in yourFriends)
```

JavaScript example
```javascript
let hasFriend = !(yourFriends.includes(neededFriend))
```

C example

_In C we would need to loop through every item in a array and check that the strings match or not._

---
class: inverse, left
# Logical OR ( || )

_If we wanted to make the game easier, we could require only one of the two conditions to be true._

Python example
```python  
(yourLocation is theLocation or neededFriend in yourFriends)
```

JavaScript example
```javascript
let levelUp = (
  yourLocation == theLocation || yourFriends.includes(neededFriend)
);
```

C example
```c
boolean levelUp = (correctLocation || neededFriend);
```

---
class: inverse, left
# Additional Operators
Just like there were more data types than we covered in class last week, there are also more operators. Here are a few types to explore on your own.

Bitwise Operators

[Python](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BitwiseOperators) | [JavaScript](https://www.w3resource.com/javascript/operators/bitwise-operator.php) | [C](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/c_bitwise_operators.htm)

[Compound Assignment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/scripting/javascript/reference/compound-assignment-operators-javascript)

[Ternary conditional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%3F:)

class: inverse, left
# Conditional Statements

Now that we've reviewed the operators that evaluate our variables into meaningful logic, we are ready to make deicisions. 

### Enter the mighty if statement!


---

class: inverse, left
Conditional Statements
## If

Python example
```python 
if (yourLocation == theLocation):
  print("you are in the right place")
```

Other python examples
```python 
x = 1
y = 2
if (x < y):
  print("x is indeed less than y")

if not(x > y):
  print("x is not greater than y")
```

---
class: inverse, left
Conditional Statements
## If


JavaScript example
```javascript
let isGreater = (x > y) // false
if (isGreater) {
  console.log( "x is greater than y")
}
```

C example
```
boolean isGreater = (x > y); // true
if (isGreater) {
  printf("isGreater is true");
}
```

---
class: inverse, left
Conditional Statements
## Else
_In the case that the conditional expression in your if statement is not true, you may want to do something else._

Python example
```python  
if (x < y):
  print("x is less than y")
else:
  print("y is less than x")
```

JavaScript example
```javascript
if (x > y) {
  console.log("x is greater than y")
} else {
  console.log("y is greater than x")
}
```
---
class: inverse, left
Conditional Statements
## Else

C example
```
if (x > y) {
  printf("x is greater than y");
} else {
  printf("y is greater than x");
}
```
---
class: inverse, left
## Elif
Python can only have one else. But it can have many `elif`

Python example
```python
import math
x = 'nan'
y = 1
if (x < y):
  print "x is less than y"
elif math.isnan(float(x)):
  print("x is NaN")
else:
  print("y is less than x")
```

# Functions

> In programming, a named section of a program that performs a specific task. In this sense, a function is a type of procedure or routine. Some programming languages make a distinction between a function, which returns a value, and a procedure, which performs some operation but does not return a value.
Most programming languages come with a prewritten set of functions that are kept in a library. You can also write your own functions to perform specialized tasks.

http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/F/function.html

---
class: inverse, left
Functions
## Declaration

Python example
```python  
def myFunction():
  # statements here
  return

```
JavaScript example
```javascript
function myFunction() {
  // statements here
}
```

C example
```
boolean myFunction () {
  // statements here
}
```

---
class: inverse, left
Functions
## Definition

Python example
```python  
def isGreater(x, y):
  return (x > y)

```

JavaScript example
```javascript
function isGreater(x, y) {
  return (x > y);
}
```

C example
```
boolean isGreater (int x, int y) {
  boolean returnVal = (x > y); // true
  return returnVal;
}
```

---
class: inverse, left
Functions
## Parameters and Arguments

In the last slide `x` and `y` are parameters of the function. 

The values you pass in for `x` and `y` are known as arguments.

Python example
```python  
def isGreater(x, y):
  return (x > y)

isGreater(0,1) #False
isGreater(1,0) #True

```

class: inverse, left
# A Forest

Similar to your story assigment last week, the forest is a game in which the user inputs some information that is given to a function that executes a series of conditionals to make decisions.

We will use data types, comparison operators, logical operators, and group our procedures into multiple functions so we can do certain things at certain times. 

### Let's dive in.

# Assignment

### Create a logic game!

Design and build a game of your own using different types of operators:

- [arithmetic](http://hello-world.areaofeffect.io/week3/slides/#8) ```=``` ```+``` ```/``` ```-``` ```%```

- [comparison](http://hello-world.areaofeffect.io/week3/slides/#13) ```!=``` ```==``` ```>``` ```<``` ```>=``` ```<=```

- [logical](http://hello-world.areaofeffect.io/week3/slides/#16) ```and``` ```(&&)``` , ```or``` ```(||)``` , ```not``` ```(!)```

- [conditional statements](http://hello-world.areaofeffect.io/week3/slides/#23) ```if``` ```elif``` ```else```

- [functions](http://hello-world.areaofeffect.io/week3/slides/#29)

---
class: inverse, left
# Assignment

Some inspirations can be: puzzle games, a sudoku checker, a card or dice games, escape the room type game or the [sample forest game](https://github.com/areaofeffect/hello-world/tree/master/week3/examples) game from class.

To start, it will help to break down your game as variables, datatypes and objects. Use a flow-chart and plan your game before writing any code. You can work in groups of 2, pair coding. Next week we will play-testing our games in class.

<br/>

### Due next week (9/28):
- Create a flow-chart of your game logic and how you imagine it working as code.
- A prototype of your game in python demonstrating conditionals and logic from your design.

class: inverse, left
# Advanced assignment
## Convert your game logic into a JavaScript web app

- Use the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library to create a visual interface for your game
- You can install a very useful plugin in vscode called [p5.vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=samplavigne.p5-vscode) to help you get started.
  - Follow the instructions in the plugin _To create a new p5 project_. And when you get to step 3, you should see a blank canvas in your browser.  

.center.center-50[![Center-aligned image](./images/p5app.png)]


---
class: inverse, left
# Advanced assignment

JavaScript apps have more parts like HTML and CSS. You can replace the index.html, sketch.js, and style.css files that you generated following the last slide with [these files](https://github.com/areaofeffect/hello-world/tree/master/week3/examples/advanced_assignment) to get started. Start by handling the case where the player choses answer B. From there are opportunities to make your own questions and options, add your own graphics, and finish the story. Make it fun :)

You will have questions. Refer to our previous slides for JavaScript syntax and most importantly the internet as reference.


Here are additional resources for learning the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, if you choose this path!:

- [W3 schools HTML Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/html)
- [W3 schools CSS Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/css)
- [Mozilla Javascript language overview](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript)
