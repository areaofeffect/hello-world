# Loops

_a loop is a sequence of instruction s that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached._

You can use loops to run sections of code over and over again.
There are many types of loops but we will focus on `for` and `while` for learning.

# "break", "return" and "continue" statements

Below is a python example that will `break` and exit the loop once the count is greator than five.

- try it out: [repl link](https://repl.it/LaMW)
- `return` will exit the app

<br/>

```python
for x in range(1,10): # a for loop that counts from 1 to 10
  if (x > 5):     # a conditional, are we less than 5
    break       # exit the loop once our count is higher than 5
  else:
    print(x)

# recursion
.center.center-25[![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/areaofeffect/hello-world/week4/week4/slides/images/RecursiveTree.jpg)]

> Factorials, Fractals, Inception

The most common application of recursion is in mathematics and computer science, where a function being defined is applied within its own definition. While this apparently defines an infinite number of instances (function values), it is often done in such a way that no loop or infinite chain of references can occur.

# draw()

A draw loop is a type of loop that occurs *every frame* of your application. It is generally used for programing animations, interactions or visuals. Think of it working like a movie or gif with sequential frames.

In Arduino programming this is simply called loop().

>After creating a setup() function, which initializes and sets the initial values, the loop() function does precisely what its name suggests, and loops consecutively, allowing your program to change and respond. Use it to actively control the Arduino board.

# Week 4 Assignment - Due 10 / 3

- Part 1. Create a generative artwork or study using loops and repetition.
<br/>

  - You can use JavaScript, p5 or python. Some inspitations:

</br>

- Part 2. Collect a dataset. Take photos using your phone throughout the week.

  - Give context to your data, maybe you take a photo everytime you smile.
  - Be sure to turn the location feature on your phone.
  - Next week we will be creating data visualizations.

<br/>

And remember...
