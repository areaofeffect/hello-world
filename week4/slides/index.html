# Loops

_a loop is a sequence of instruction s that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached._

You can use loops to run sections of code over and over again.
There are many types of loops but we will focus on <span style="color:white">for</span> and <span style="color:white">while</span>.

# why use loops?

- cleaner and more efficient code
- looping through an arrays and lists
- repetition / patterns
- because they are already there, like draw() and loop()
- generative art

# recursion
.center.center-25[![image](../images/RecursiveTree.jpg)]

> Factorials, Fractals, Inception

The most common application of recursion is in mathematics and computer science, where a function being defined is applied within its own definition. While this apparently defines an infinite number of instances (function values), it is often done in such a way that no loop or infinite chain of references can occur.

# draw() and loop()

A draw loop is a type of loop that occurs *every frame* of your application. It is generally used for programing animations, interactions or visuals. Think of it working like a movie or gif with sequential frames.

In Arduino programming this is simply called loop().

>After creating a setup() function, which initializes and sets the initial values, the loop() function does precisely what its name suggests, and loops consecutively, allowing your program to change and respond. Use it to actively control the Arduino board.

# Review of Syntax

Helpful hints in
- Remember to choose your language for syntax highlighting
- [Common Shortcuts](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/general-keyboard-shortcuts-for-visual-studio-code/)
- You can also choose to install linters for your language of choice 
- Visual Studio Code has many built in features that can help you write code faster and more efficiently, you can even customize [your own Terminal appearance](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/appearance)

# Tkinter

Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.
