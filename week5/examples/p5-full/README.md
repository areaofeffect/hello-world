# Arduino + p5 Serial Examples


### Some helpful tips

- [Here is a tutorial outlining](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/labs/labs-serial-communication/lab-serial-input-to-the-p5-js-ide/) how to setup your arduino and p5 code to talk to each other.

- Take a look at the **serial-example-graph** and **serial-example-simple** sketches to start.

- Remember to [P5 Serial control application](https://github.com/vanevery/p5.serialcontrol/releases). This serves as a data bridge between Arduino and your p5 sketch.
