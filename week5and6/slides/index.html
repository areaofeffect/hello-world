# Scope

Scope refers to the part of a program where a name binding, like an assigment of a value to a variable, is valid.

Ok, but what does 'part of a program' mean?

---
class: inverse, left
# Lexical Scope

_lexical: relating to the words or vocabulary of a language._

Also referred to as static scope. In this type of scope the machine resovles variable by its location in the source code. 

```javascript
function foo() {
  console.log( a ); // 2
}

function bar() {
  var a = 3;
  foo();
}

var a = 2;

bar();
```

---
class: inverse, left
# Dynamic Scope

In this type of scope, variables may be resolved by using the state of the program at run time. Dynamic scope is uncommon in most modern languages.

```javascript
function foo() {
  console.log( a ); // 3
}

function bar() {
  var a = 3;
  foo();
}

var a = 2;

bar();
```
---
class: inverse, left
# Dynamic Scope

> How can this be? Because when `foo()` cannot resolve the variable reference for a, instead of stepping up the nested (lexical) scope chain, it walks up the call-stack, to find where `foo()` was called from. Since `foo()` was called from `bar()`, it checks the variables in scope for `bar()`, and finds an a there with value 3.

# Interlude

## foo?? bar??? whaaa?

[metasyntactic variable](http://www.outpost9.com/reference/jargon/jargon_28.html#TAG1136)

> A name used in examples and understood to stand for whatever thing is under discussion, or any random member of a class of things under discussion.

> The etymology of hackish `foo` is obscure. When used in connection with `bar` it is generally traced to the WWII-era Army slang acronym FUBAR ('Fucked Up Beyond All Repair'), later bowdlerized to foobar.

# Levels of Scope

* Expression
* Block
* Function
* File
* Module
* Global

---
class: inverse, left
# Expression Scope

here a declaration's scope is a single expression, like a [let](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) statement

```javascript
function varTest() {
  var x = 1;
  if (true) {
    var x = 2;  // same variable!
    console.log(x); }
  console.log(x);
}
```

```javascript
function letTest() {
  let x = 1;
  if (true) {
    let x = 2;  // different variable
    console.log(x); }
  console.log(x);
}
```

---
class: inverse, left
# Block Scope

You can think of this type of scope, as contained within curly braces `{}`

```javascript
for (var i=0; i<10; i++) {
  console.log( i );
}
```

---
class: inverse, left
# Function Scope

Most blocks are contained in functions, which can have it's own scope. Functions can contain local variables which only apply to that subroutine.

```
function foo(a) {
  var b = 2;
  function bar() {
    // ...
  }
  var c = 3;
}

bar(); // what happens?
console.log(a, b, c); // what happens?
```

---
class: inverse, left
# File Scope

Variables and functions declared at the top level of a file (not within any function) is for the entire file. Arduino sketches have this type of scope. You will recall that these top level variables were available to your entire program.

```c
int led = 9;           // the PWM pin the LED is attached to
int brightness = 0;    // how bright the LED is
int fadeAmount = 5;    // how many points to fade the LED by
```

# Module Scope

Before we talk about module scope, let's talk about what a module is. Essentially it's a set of functions you want to include in your program.

# Module scope in Python

Think of this way, your games were modules, and some of them included another module named <span style="color:white">playsound</span> that included a set of functionality to play sounds.

# Module scope in Node.js

In node.js, anything declared with the var keyword at the top level (not inside a function or object, or any other block) of a file is in module scope, and will be accessible from anywhere within the same file, but will not exist anywhere else.

[Node.js Modules](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_modules.asp)

---
class: inverse, left
# Global Scope
A declaration has global scope if it has effect throughout an entire program. Variable names with global scope — called global variables — are frequently considered bad practice, at least in some languages, due to the possibility of name collisions and unintentional masking, together with poor modularity, and function scope or block scope are considered preferable.

# Python Modules

A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended.

Rather than the term library in the Python, the term package is used.

# JavaScript Modules

* Write your own

* Use [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

> npm, short for Node Package Manager, is two things: first and foremost, it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects; second, it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management.

  }
