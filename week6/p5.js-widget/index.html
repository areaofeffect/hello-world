<title>Interactivity</title>
<h1>Interactivity</h1>

<p>
The screen forms a bridge between our bodies and the realm of circuits and electricity inside computers. We control elements on screen through a variety of devices such as touch pads, trackballs, and joysticks, but the keyboard and mouse remain the most common input devices for desktop computers. The computer mouse dates back to the late 1960s, when Douglas Engelbart presented the device as an element of the oN-Line System (NLS), one of the first computer systems with a video display. The mouse concept was further developed at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), but its introduction with the Apple Macintosh in 1984 was the catalyst for its current ubiquity. The design of the mouse has gone through many revisions in the last forty years, but its function has remained the same. In Engelbart's original patent application in 1970 he referred to the mouse as an "X-Y position indicator," and this still accurately, but dryly, defines its contemporary use.
</p>

<p>
The physical mouse object is used to control the position of the cursor on screen and to select interface elements. The cursor position is read by computer programs as two numbers, the x-coordinate and the y-coordinate. These numbers can be used to control attributes of elements on screen. If these coordinates are collected and analyzed, they can be used to extract higher-level information such as the speed and direction of the mouse. This data can in turn be used for gesture and pattern recognition.
</p>

<p>
Keyboards are typically used to input characters for composing documents, email, and instant messages, but the keyboard has potential for use beyond its original intent. The migration of the keyboard from typewriter to computer expanded its function to enable launching software, moving through the menus of software applications, and navigating 3D environments in games. When writing your own software, you have the freedom to use the keyboard data any way you wish. For example, basic information such as the speed and rhythm of the fingers can be determined by the rate at which keys are pressed. This information could control the speed of an event or the quality of motion. It's also possible to ignore the characters printed on the keyboard itself and use the location of each key relative to the keyboard grid as a numeric position.
</p>

<p>
The modern computer keyboard is a direct descendant of the typewriter. The position of the keys on an English-language keyboard is inherited from early typewriters. This layout is called QWERTY because of the order of the top row of letter keys. It was developed for typewriters to put physical distance between frequently typed letter pairs, helping reduce the likelihood of the typebars colliding and jamming as they hit the ribbon. This more than one-hundred-year-old mechanical legacy still affects how we write software today.

<!-- coordinate system -->
<h2 id="coordinate-system">p5 Coordinate System</h2>

<p>In p5 the coordinate system starts with 0,0 at the top left. This will be the basis for interacting with the canvas and drawing objects to the screen.</p>

<br/>

<center><img src="https://processing.org/reference/environment/images/coordinates2D3D.png"></img></center>

<br/><br/>

<h1>Mouse Data</h1>
<p>
The p5 variables mouseX and mouseY (note the capital X and Y) store the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the cursor relative to the origin in the upper-left corner of the display window. To see the actual values produced while moving the mouse, run this program to print the values to the console:
</p>

<p>
When a program starts, the mouseX and mouseY values are 0. If the cursor moves into the display window, the values are set to the current position of the cursor. If the cursor is at the left, the mouseX value is 0 and the value increases as the cursor moves to the right. If the cursor is at the top, the mouseY value is 0 and the value increases as the cursor moves down. If mouseX and mouseY are used in programs without a draw() or if noLoop() is run in setup(), the values will always be 0.
</p>

<script type="text/p5" data-autoplay data-hide-sourcecode data-preview-width="250" data-height="600">
var xPos;
var yPos;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200); // create a window for our sketch
  rectMode(CENTER); // draw rectangles from the center
}

function draw() {
  background(127);
  fill(0,0,255);
  rect(xPos, yPos, 25, 25);
  text("x: " + int(mouseX) + " y: " + int(mouseY), 0, 10);
}

function mouseMoved() {
  // capture the mouse positions into our variables
  xPos = mouseX;
  yPos = mouseY;
}
</script>

<br/><br/>

<!-- mouse position -->
<h2 id="simple-mapping">Mapping your mouse position</h2>
<p>
The mouse position is most commonly used to control the location of visual elements on screen. More interesting relations are created when the visual elements relate differently to the mouse values, rather than simply mimicking the current position. Adding and subtracting values from the mouse position creates relationships that remain constant, while multiplying and dividing these values creates changing visual relationships between the mouse position and the elements on the screen. The square below has it's rotation directly mapped to the cursor.
</p>
<p>Rotate and scale the square based on your mouse position<p>
<script type="text/p5" data-autoplay data-hide-sourcecode data-preview-width="250" data-height="600">
function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200);
  background(127);
  rectMode(CENTER);
}

function draw() {
  background(127)

  translate(width/2, height/2); // translation to center

  // map the mouse X position to radians
  var mappedValueX = map(mouseX, 0, 200, 0, 2*PI);
  
  // map the mouse Y position to scale
  var mappedValueY = map(mouseY, 0, 200, 0, 5);

  // scale the sketch based on mouse position
  scale(mappedValueY);

  // rotate the sketch based on the mouse position
  rotate(mappedValueX);

  // draw the rectangle
  fill(255,255,0);
  rect(0, 0, 50, 50);
}

</script>

<br/><br/>

<h1>Mouse Events</h1>
<p>
Computer mice and other related input devices typically have between one and three buttons; Processing can detect when these buttons are pressed with the mousePressed and mouseButton variables. Used with the button status, the cursor position enables the mouse to perform different actions. For example, a button press when the mouse is over an icon can select it, so the icon can be moved to a different location on screen. The mousePressed variable is true if any mouse button is pressed and false if no mouse button is pressed. The variable mouseButton is LEFT, CENTER, or RIGHT depending on the mouse button most recently pressed. The mousePressed variable reverts to false as soon as the button is released, but the mouseButton variable retains its value until a different button is pressed. These variables can be used independently or in combination to control the software. Run these programs to see how the software responds to your fingers.
</p>

<i>The mouse event functions are mousePressed(), mouseReleased(), mouseMoved(), and mouseDragged():</i>

<h3>mouseReleased()</h3>
<p>Code inside this block is run one time when a mouse button is pressed mouseReleased()</p>

<h3>mouseMoved()</h3>
<p>Code inside this block is run one time when a mouse button is released mouseMoved()</p>

<h3>mouseDragged()</h3>
<p>Code inside this block is run one time when the mouse is moved mouseDragged()</p>


<h3>mousePressed()</h3>
<p>Code inside this block is run one time when the mouse is moved while a mouse button is pressed</p>

<!-- rectangular button -->
<h2 id="rectangular-button">Rectangular Button</h2>

The most common type of bounding box is a rectangle. Our mouse is inside a rectangle when `mouseX` and `mouseY` are inside it's bounds.

The bounds of a rectangle can be thought of like its area.

- x position of the rectangle plus the rectangles width
- y position of the rectangle plus the rectangles height

<script type="text/p5" data-autoplay data-hide-sourcecode data-preview-width="250" data-height="600">
var backgroundColor;
var isOverRectangle; // boolean!
 
function setup() {
  // set canvas size
  createCanvas(200, 200);
  backgroundColor = color(127, 127, 127);
}
 
function draw() {
  background(backgroundColor);
 
  // check if mouse is inside the rectangle
  // formula: (mouseX >= x && mouseX <= x+width) && (mouseY >= y && mouseY <= y+height)

  if (mouseX >= 75 && mouseX <= 125 && mouseY >= 75 && mouseY <= 125) {
    isOverRectangle = true;
  } else {
    isOverRectangle = false;
  }
  
  // draw a rectangle
  stroke(0);
  strokeWeight(5);
  
  if(isOverRectangle == true) {
    fill(100);
    cursor(HAND); // change the cursor!
  } 
  else {
    fill(200); 
    cursor(ARROW); 
  }

  rect(75, 75, 50, 50);
}
 
function mousePressed() {
  // wwe check if we are over the rectangle when the mouse is pressed
  if(isOverRectangle == true) {
    backgroundColor = color(random(255), random(255), random(255));
  }
}
</script>

<br/><br/>

<!-- circular button -->
<h2 id="circular-button">Circular Button</h2>
We can calculate the distance from our mouse position to the center of a point. If this value is less than the radius of your object - our mouse cursor must be inside. See the example below.

<script type="text/p5" data-autoplay data-hide-sourcecode data-preview-width="250" data-height="600">
var backgroundColor;
var isOverCircle;
 
function setup() {
  // set canvas size
  createCanvas(200, 200);
  backgroundColor = color(127, 127, 127);
  ellipseMode(CENTER);
}
 
function draw() {
  background(backgroundColor);
 
  // get distance between mouse and center of the circle
  var distance = dist(mouseX, mouseY, 100, 100);
  fill(255);
  text("distance: " + int(distance), 0, 10);

  // if the distance is less than the circle's radius
  if(distance < 25) {
    isOverCircle = true;
  } else {
    isOverCircle = false;
  }
  
  // draw a circle

  if(isOverCircle == true) {
    fill(0,255,0);
    cursor(HAND);
  } else {
    fill(200); 
    cursor(ARROW); 
  }
  
  stroke(0);
  ellipse(100, 100, 50, 50);

  line(100,100,mouseX, mouseY);
  
}
 
function mousePressed() {
  if(isOverCircle == true) {
    backgroundColor = color(random(255), random(255), random(255));
  }
}

<h1>Keyboard Event</h1>
<p>p5 registers the most recently pressed key and whether a key is currently pressed. The boolean variable keyPressed is true if a key is pressed and is false if not. Include this variable in the test of an if structure to allow lines of code to run only if a key is pressed. The keyPressed variable remains true while the key is held down and becomes false only when the key is released.</p>

<h3>keyPressed()</h3>
<h3>keyReleased()</h3>

<p>
In addition to reading key values for numbers, letters, and symbols. If you're making cross-platform projects, note that the Enter key is commonly used on PCs and UNIX and the Return key is used on Macintosh. Check for both Enter and Return to make sure your program will work for all platforms.
</p>

<p>
*The variable keyCode is used to detect special keys such as BACKSPACE, DELETE, ENTER, RETURN, TAB, ESCAPE, SHIFT, CONTROL, OPTION, ALT, UP_ARROW, DOWN_ARROW, LEFT_ARROW, RIGHT_ARROW You can also check for custom keys by looking up the keyCode of any key on a site like this: [http://keycode.info/](http://keycode.info/)*
</p>


<pre>
if (keyCode == UP_ARROW) {
    y += 1;
}
</pre>

<h3>key</h3>
The key variable stores a single alphanumeric character. Specifically, it holds the most recently pressed key. The key can be displayed on screen with the text() function (p. 150).

<pre>text(key, 33,65); // Display last key pressed.</pre>

The key variable may be used to determine whether a specific key is pressed. The following example uses the expression key=='A' to test if the A key is pressed. The single quotes signify A as the data type char (p. 144). The expression key == "A" will cause an error because the double quotes signify the A as a String, and it's not possible to compare a String with a char. The logical AND symbol, the && operator, is used to connect the expression with the keyPressed variable to ascertain that the key pressed is the uppercase A.

<h3>keyIsPressed</h3>
<pre>
function draw() {
  background(0);
  // If the 'A' key is pressed fill white
  if ((keyIsPressed == true) && (key == 'A')) {
    fill(255);
  } else {
     // otherwise, fill black
    fill(0);
  }
}
</pre>

<p>
The previous example works with an uppercase A, but not if the lowercase letter is pressed. To check for both uppercase and lowercase letters, extend the relational expression with a logical OR, the || relational operator. Line 4 in the previous program would be changed to:
</p>

<pre>
if ((keyIsPressed == true) && ((key == 'a') || (key == 'A'))) {
  // your code here
}
</pre>

<p>
Because each character has a numeric value as defined by the ASCII table (p. 605), the value of the key variable can be used like any other number to control visual attributes such as the position and color of shape elements. For instance, the ASCII table defines the uppercase A as the number 65, and the digit 1 is defined as 49.
