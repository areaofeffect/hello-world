# Mouse Events

Computer mice and other related input devices typically have between one and three buttons; Processing can detect when these buttons are pressed with the mousePressed and mouseButton variables. Used with the button status, the cursor position enables the mouse to perform different actions. For example, a button press when the mouse is over an icon can select it, so the icon can be moved to a different location on screen. The mousePressed variable is true if any mouse button is pressed and false if no mouse button is pressed. The variable mouseButton is LEFT, CENTER, or RIGHT depending on the mouse button most recently pressed. The mousePressed variable reverts to false as soon as the button is released, but the mouseButton variable retains its value until a different button is pressed. These variables can be used independently or in combination to control the software. Run these programs to see how the software responds to your mouse (computer) or fingers (mobile).

---

class: inverse, left, top, small

# Mouse position

The p5 variables mouseX and mouseY (note the capital X and Y) store the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the cursor relative to the origin in the upper-left corner of the display window. To see the actual values produced while moving the mouse, run this program to print the values to the console:

[position example](../examples/p5/mouse-position/)

```javascript

function draw() {
  background(127);
  fill(0,0,255);
  rect(xPos, yPos, 25, 25);
  text("x: " + int(mouseX) + " y: " + int(mouseY), 0, 10);
}

function mouseMoved() {
  // capture the mouse positions into our variables
  xPos = mouseX;
  yPos = mouseY;
}
```

---

class: inverse, left, top, small

# Mouse position and mapping

The mouse position is most commonly used to control the location of visual elements on screen. More interesting relations are created when the visual elements relate differently to the mouse values, rather than simply mimicking the current position. Adding and subtracting values from the mouse position creates relationships that remain constant, while multiplying and dividing these values creates changing visual relationships between the mouse position and the elements on the screen. The square below has it's rotation directly mapped to the cursor.

[mapping example](../examples/p5/mouse-mapping/)

```javascript
function draw() {
  background(127)

  translate(width/2, height/2); // translation to center
  var mappedValueX = map(mouseX, 0, 200, 0, 2*PI); // map the mouse X position to radians
  var mappedValueY = map(mouseY, 0, 200, 0, 5); // map the mouse Y position to scale
  scale(mappedValueY); // scale the sketch based on mouse position
  rotate(mappedValueX); // rotate the sketch based on the mouse position

  // draw the rectangle
  fill(255,255,0);
  rect(0, 0, 50, 50);
}
```

# A simple drawing app

Drag your mouse cursor to draw

[drawing app example](../examples/p5/simple-drawing-app/)

```
function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200);
  strokeWeight(10)
  background(127);
}

function mouseDragged() {
  // drag to draw a line from previouse mouse position
  // to current mouse position
  stroke(random(255),random(255),random(255));
  line(mouseX, mouseY, pmouseX, pmouseY);
}
```
---

class: inverse, left, top, large

# Rectangular Buttons

The most common type of bounding box is a rectangle. Our mouse is inside a rectangle when `mouseX` and `mouseY` are inside it's bounds.

The bounds of a rectangle can be thought of like its area.

- x position of the rectangle plus the rectangles width
- y position of the rectangle plus the rectangles height

---

class: inverse, left, top, small

# Rectangular Buttons

[rectangular button example](../examples/p5/button-rectangular/)

[drag and drop example](../examples/p5/simple-draggable)



Snippet: 

```javascript
if (mouseX >= 75 && mouseX <= 125 && mouseY >= 75 && mouseY <= 125) {
  isOverRectangle = true;
} else {
  isOverRectangle = false;
}

// draw a rectangle
stroke(0);
strokeWeight(5);

if(isOverRectangle == true) {
  fill(100);
  cursor(HAND); // change the cursor!
} 
else {
  fill(200); 
  cursor(ARROW); 
}

```
---

class: inverse, left, top

# Circular Buttons

We can calculate the distance from our mouse position to the center of a point. If this value is less than the radius of your object - our mouse cursor is inside.

[circular buttons example](../examples/p5/button-circular/)

Snippet:

```javascript
// if the distance is less than the circle's radius
if(distance < 25) {
  isOverCircle = true;
} else {
  isOverCircle = false;
}
```
---

class: inverse, left, top, small

# Handling keyboard inputs

p5 registers the most recently pressed key and whether a key is currently pressed. The boolean variable keyPressed is true if a key is pressed and is false if not. Include this variable in the test of an if structure to allow lines of code to run only if a key is pressed. The keyPressed variable remains true while the key is held down and becomes false only when the key is released.

```javascript
function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200);
  fill(245, 123, 158);
  textSize(50);
}

function draw() {
  background(200);
  text(key, 65, 65); // Display last key pressed.
}
```
---

class: inverse, left, top, small

# Handling keyboard inputs

In addition to reading key values for numbers, letters, and symbols. If you're making cross-platform projects, note that the Enter key is commonly used on PCs and UNIX and the Return key is used on Macintosh. Check for both Enter and Return to make sure your program will work for all platforms.

*The variable keyCode is used to detect special keys such as BACKSPACE, DELETE, ENTER, RETURN, TAB, ESCAPE, SHIFT, CONTROL, OPTION, ALT, UP_ARROW, DOWN_ARROW, LEFT_ARROW, RIGHT_ARROW You can also check for custom keys by looking up the keyCode of any key on a site like this: [http://keycode.info/](http://keycode.info/)*

```
if (keyCode == UP_ARROW) {
  y += 1;
}
```

---

class: inverse, left, top, large

# Handling keyboard inputs

key:

The key variable stores a single alphanumeric character. Specifically, it holds the most recently pressed key. The key can be displayed on screen with the text() function.

```javascript
text(key, 33,65); // Display last key pressed.
```

---

class: inverse, left, top

# Handling keyboard inputs

This example works with an uppercase A, but not if the lowercase letter is pressed. To check for both uppercase and lowercase letters, extend the relational expression with a logical OR, the || relational operator. Line 4 in the previous program would be changed to:

keyIsPressed:

```javascript
function draw() {
  background(0);
  // If the 'A' key is pressed fill white
  if ((keyIsPressed == true) && (key == 'A')) {
    fill(255);
  } else {
     // otherwise, fill black
    fill(0);
  }
}
```

example conditional:
```
if ((keyIsPressed == true) && ((key == 'a') || (key == 'A'))) {
  // your code here
}
```

---

class: inverse, left, top

# ASCII Table

Because each character has a numeric value as defined by the ASCII table, the value of the key variable can be used like any other number to control visual attributes such as the position and color of shape elements. For instance, the ASCII table defines the uppercase A as the number 65, and the digit 1 is defined as 49.

---

class: inverse, left, top, large

# Simple movement

[simple movement example](../examples/p5/keyboard-movement/)

```javascript
function keyPressed(){
  // UP key
  if(keyCode == UP_ARROW) {
    ypos = ypos - numPixels; 
  }
 
  // DOWN key
  if(keyCode == DOWN_ARROW) { 
    ypos = ypos + numPixels; 
  }
 
  // RIGHT key
  if(keyCode == RIGHT_ARROW) {
    xpos = xpos + numPixels; 
  }
 
  // LEFT key
  if(keyCode == LEFT_ARROW) {
    xpos = xpos - numPixels; 
  }

  return false;
}
```
---

class: inverse, left, top, large

# Movement + Easing

[movement + easing example](../examples/p5/keyboard-movement-smoothing/)

```javascript
function calculateEasing() {
  let dx = targetX - xpos;
  xpos += dx * easing;
  
  let dy = targetY - ypos;
  ypos += dy * easing;
}
```

---

class: inverse, left, top, small

# Movement + Gameobject

[movement + game object example](../examples/p5/keyboard-movement-objects/)

```javascript
function gameObject() {

  this.x = width / 2;
  this.y = width / 2;

  this.hmom = 0;
  this.vmom = 0;

  this.speed = 10;
  this.size = 25;

  this.update = function() {
    this.move();
    this.render();
  }

  this.move = function() {
    this.x += this.hmom;
    this.y += this.vmom;

    // dampenings
    this.hmom *= 0.9;
    this.vmom *= 0.9;

    this.checkCollisions();
  }

# Week 7 Assignment

One button game.

Convert a classic arcade game into a one-button game
by “automating” (eliminating) interactions that are
customarily under control of the player. For example,
Space Invaders uses two sets of controls: one to move
the player's laser cannon back and forth, and another to
fire at descending aliens. It can be changed into a one-
button game by making the cannon move back and forth
on an automatic schedule.

Modify the problem scope so that your game uses
continuously valued data from a single sensor, such as a
slider, knob, photoresistor, or microphone.
