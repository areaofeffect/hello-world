# Computer Vision

Computer vision is an interdisciplinary scientific field that deals with how computers can gain high-level understanding from digital images or videos. From the perspective of engineering, it seeks to understand and automate tasks that the human visual system can do.

# Feature extraction

There is no universal or exact definition of what constitutes a feature, and the exact definition often depends on the problem or the type of application. Nevertheless, a feature is typically defined as an "interesting" part of an image, and features are used as a starting point for many computer vision algorithms.

# Low level feature detection, pixel by pixel

- Average brightness (is the image overall light or dark)  
- Thresholding (simplest form of segmenting an image)  
- Brightest point   
- Color detection  
- Background subtraction  
- Frame difference (good starting point for motion detection)  


---
class: inverse, left
# Medium level feature detection, region by region

- Motion history (which direction is the object moving)
- Point tracking (feature based optical flow)
- Optical flow (dense optical flow)
- Edge detection  
- Contour detection

---
class: inverse, left
# Higher level feature detection, object by object

- Facetracking
- Object detection
- Object classification
- Fiducial tracking (AR)

# Computer Vision | Homework


1. Use what you've learned about face tracking and create a face generator

2. Take what you've learned and apply some concept to past homework
