# What is Application State?

**State** is the current condition or mode of your program at any given moment.

Think of it like the "memory" of your application - it remembers:
- Where you are in the program
- What the user is doing
- What should happen next

Just like everyday objects, programs have states too:

💡 **Light Switch**: ON or OFF

🚦 **Traffic Light**: Red, Yellow, Green

📱 **Phone**: Locked or Unlocked


---

class: inverse, left, top, large

# State in Your Daily Life

Examples of state you encounter every day:

- **Traffic Light**: Red, Yellow, Green
- **Phone**: Locked, Unlocked, Calling, In App
- **Door**: Open, Closed, Locked
- **Music Player**: Playing, Paused, Stopped
- **Oven**: Off, Preheating, Ready, Cooking

Each state determines what can happen next!

---

# State in Your Python Game

Remember your choose-your-own-adventure game? **You were already using state!**

```python
location = "forest"
health = 100
has_key = False
```

Your game tracked:
- **Where the player is** (location state)
- **How much health they have** (numeric state)
- **What items they've collected** (boolean state)

The program "remembered" these values and used them to determine what happens next!

---

class: inverse, left, top

# Why State Matters

Interactive programs need to **remember things** and **respond differently** based on what happened before.

🎮 **Games**
- Player score, level, power-ups
- Enemy behavior and health
- Menu vs gameplay vs game over

🎨 **Art Applications**
- Tool selected (brush, eraser, fill)
- Color chosen
- Drawing mode (freehand vs shapes)

🤖 **Virtual Pets**
- Mood (happy, sad, hungry)
- Energy and health levels
- Time since last interaction

---

# State in Games

Most games have at least these three states:

1. **MENU** - Start screen, waiting to play
2. **PLAYING** - Active gameplay
3. **GAMEOVER** - Game ended, show score

Some games have more states:
- PAUSED
- LOADING
- CUTSCENE
- LEVEL_COMPLETE
- SETTINGS

---

class: inverse, left, top

# State in Applications

Apps use state to track what screen or mode you're in:

**Social Media App:**
- Login screen
- Feed view
- Profile view
- Settings
- Composing a post
- Viewing a photo

**The current state determines:**
- What appears on screen
- What buttons do
- What data is loaded

---

class: inverse, left, top

# What is a State Machine?

A **state machine** is a design pattern where your program can be in ONE state at a time, and transitions between states based on rules.

🎯 **One State at a Time**
- Only one active state at any moment
- No confusion about what mode you're in

🔄 **Transitions**
- Clear rules for changing states
- Events trigger state changes

⚡ **Actions**
- Each state has different behavior
- Different rendering and responses

Think of it like a map of your program's possible modes!

# State Machine Diagram Example

```
    ┌─────────┐
    │  MENU   │
    └────┬────┘
         │ (press SPACE)
         ▼
    ┌─────────┐
    │ PLAYING │
    └────┬────┘
         │ (timer ends)
         ▼
    ┌─────────┐
    │GAMEOVER │
    └────┬────┘
         │ (press SPACE)
         └──────────────► back to MENU
```

# Simple State: Toggle Button

The simplest state example - a button that switches between two states.

```javascript
// Track the state
let isOn = false;

function setup() {
  createCanvas(200, 200);
}

function draw() {
  // Draw based on state
  if (isOn) {
    background(255, 255, 0);  // Yellow when ON
    text("ON", 90, 100);
  } else {
    background(100);  // Gray when OFF
    text("OFF", 85, 100);
  }
}

function mousePressed() {
  // Toggle the state
  isOn = !isOn;
}
```

**Result:** The button remembers if it's ON or OFF!

# Multiple States: Traffic Light

When you have more than two options, use strings to represent states.

```javascript
let light = "green";

function draw() {
  background(50);

  if (light === "green") {
    fill(0, 255, 0);
    text("GO!", 90, 100);
  } else if (light === "yellow") {
    fill(255, 255, 0);
    text("SLOW", 85, 100);
  } else if (light === "red") {
    fill(255, 0, 0);
    text("STOP", 85, 100);
  }

  ellipse(100, 50, 40, 40);
}
```

**Three possible states:** 🟢 GREEN → 🟡 YELLOW → 🔴 RED

---

class: inverse, left, top, large

# Implementing State in P5.js

The basic pattern:

```javascript
let gameState = "MENU";  // Current state

function draw() {
  if (gameState === "MENU") {
    drawMenu();
  } else if (gameState === "PLAYING") {
    drawGame();
  } else if (gameState === "GAMEOVER") {
    drawGameOver();
  }
}
```

Draw different things based on the current state!

---

class: inverse, left, top

# State Transitions

Change state when events happen:

```javascript
function keyPressed() {
  if (key === ' ') {
    if (gameState === "MENU") {
      gameState = "PLAYING";
      score = 0;  // Reset game
      timer = 300;
    } else if (gameState === "GAMEOVER") {
      gameState = "MENU";
    }
  }
}

function draw() {
  if (gameState === "PLAYING") {
    timer--;
    if (timer <= 0) {
      gameState = "GAMEOVER";  // Time's up!
    }
  }
}
```

# More Complex State: Virtual Creatures

State machines can model complex behaviors!

A virtual creature might have states like:
- **HAPPY** - Well fed and rested
- **HUNGRY** - Needs food
- **TIRED** - Needs rest
- **BORED** - Needs play
- **ANGRY** - Multiple needs unmet

Each state affects how the creature looks and behaves.

---

class: inverse, left, top

# Virtual Creature: Managing Stats

Complex state often depends on multiple variables:

```javascript
class Creature {
  constructor() {
    this.hunger = 50;   // 0-100
    this.energy = 50;   // 0-100
    this.happiness = 50; // 0-100
    this.mood = "HAPPY";
  }

  update() {
    // Stats decay over time
    this.hunger = constrain(this.hunger - 0.1, 0, 100);
    this.energy = constrain(this.energy - 0.05, 0, 100);

    this.updateMood();  // Determine state based on stats
  }
}
```

---

class: inverse, left, top

# Virtual Creature: State Logic

```javascript
updateMood() {
  // Priority-based state transitions
  if (this.hunger < 20) {
    this.mood = "HUNGRY";
  } else if (this.energy < 20) {
    this.mood = "TIRED";
  } else if (this.happiness < 30) {
    this.mood = "BORED";
  } else if (this.hunger < 40 && this.energy < 40) {
    this.mood = "ANGRY";
  } else {
    this.mood = "HAPPY";
  }
}
```

The creature's state emerges from its stats!

# Live Example: Virtual Creature

[Virtual Creature Demo](https://brunokruse.github.io/week7-interactive/examples/p5/virtual-creature/learn.html)

Try interacting with the creature:
- Feed it when hungry
- Let it rest when tired
- Play with it when bored
- Watch how its mood changes!

# Example: State Machine Game

A simple game demonstrating the three-state pattern:

[State Machine Game Demo](https://brunokruse.github.io/week7-interactive/examples/p5/challenges/challenge-05-state-machine/learn.html)

Shows how to:
- Create MENU, PLAYING, GAMEOVER states
- Handle state transitions with keyboard
- Display different content per state
- Manage game variables across states
- Reset and restart properly

# Key Concepts to Remember

1. **State** = the current mode/condition of your program
2. **One state at a time** = clear, predictable behavior
3. **State transitions** = events that change state
4. **Different rendering** = each state looks different
5. **Different behaviors** = each state acts different

State machines help you organize complex interactive programs!

# Applying State Machines to YOUR Project

Think about your own project ideas:

**Does your project have different modes or screens?**
- Menu vs gameplay
- Different tools or editing modes
- Tutorial vs normal mode

**Does your project have objects with changing behavior?**
- Characters with moods or actions
- Interactive elements with multiple states

**Does your project respond to conditions?**
- Health/energy systems
- Day/night or weather changes
- Difficulty adjustments

# How State Machines Help

**Organization**
- Clear structure instead of nested if-statements
- Each state has its own section of code

**Debugging**
- Easy to see what state you're in
- Test each state independently

**Extension**
- Adding new features is easier
- Need a pause menu? Add a new state!

---

class: inverse, left, top

# Getting Started

1. **Identify 2-3 states** your project already has
2. **Draw a state diagram** on paper
3. **Implement one state** and test it
4. **Add transitions** one at a time
5. **Refine** as your project grows

Start simple. Add complexity as needed.

---

class: inverse, left, top

# Tips for State Machines

**Keep it organized:**
- Use clear, descriptive state names (ALL_CAPS helps)
- Draw a state diagram on paper first
- One state variable, many rendering functions
- Handle state transitions in one place (like keyPressed)

**Debugging:**
- Print the current state to the console
- Color-code your states while developing
- Test each state individually
- Make sure ALL transitions work both ways
